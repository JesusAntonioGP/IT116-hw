        Image result for math and science
        In many ways, math is closely related to science. Mathematics is a scholarly domain, 
        and so the mathematical community works as the scientific community does â€” mathematicians
         build on each other's work and behave in ways that push the discipline forward.
          This progress contributes to scientific breakthroughs.</p>

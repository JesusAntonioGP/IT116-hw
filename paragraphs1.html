    <h1>The Bee Movie...</h1>
        <p>Fresh out of college, Barry the Bee (Jerry Seinfeld) finds 
            the prospect of working with honey uninspiring. He flies 
            outside the hive for the first time and talks to a human (Ren√©e Zellweger),
             breaking a cardinal rule of his species. Barry learns that humans have been
              stealing and eating honey for centuries, and he realizes that his true calling
               is to obtain justice for his kind by suing humanity for theft.</p>

    <h2>Part 1... The beginning</h2>
     <p>Narrator:
      According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
        
        (Barry is picking out a shirt)
        
        Barry:
        Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.
        
        Janet:
        Barry! Breakfast is ready!</p>

                                Barry:
                                Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
                                
                                Adam:
                                Wow. I've never seen them this close.
                                
                                Barry:
                                They know what it's like outside the hive.
                                
                                Adam:
                                Yeah, but some don't come back.
                                
                                Girl Bees:

         <h3>not really a conclusion but the end for now</h3>
            <p>Lou Lo Duva:
                OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
                
                Barry:
                That's awful.
                
                Lou Lo Duva:
                (Still talking through megaphone) And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions!
                
                Pollen Jocks:
                (The Pollen Jocks run into formation) Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!</P>
